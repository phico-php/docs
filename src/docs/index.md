## What is Phico

Phico is a small PHP framework that aims to strike a middle ground between micro-frameworks like [Slim](https://slimframework.com) and heavyweight frameworks like [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
Although it is small Phico aims to punch above its weight by offering:
- **HTTP adaptability** supporting Requests, Responses and Middleware.
- **Obvious configuration** with centralised config access and env file support
- **Scriptable CLI support** by extending the built in CLI class
- **Blade view syntax** via a standlone Blade renderer
- **Fluent SQL query support** via a standalone SQL query builder
- **and more** ...

<!--
## Database

Database provides consistent access to SQL databases via PDO, currently MySQL, Postgres and SQLite are supported.

## Query

Query creates SQL statements via a fluent API similar to Laravel's eloquent, it has no dependencies, it is designed purely to output strings of SQL and arrays of query parameters. Currently MySQL, Postgres and SQLite dialects are supported.
