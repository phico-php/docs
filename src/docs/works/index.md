# Works
Works comprises a selection of base classes to support Domain Driven Design.
There are base classes for ValueObjects, Input Filters, Repositories, Entities, Collections, Mappers, Pagers and more.

Works provides CLI tools for scaffolding app files.
Even better - it can also generate app classes such as Actions, Controllers, Entities, Types and Repositories from UML files created in [System Designer](https://designfirst.io/systemdesigner/).

Works enables you to quickly visually create your application architecture and automatically generate much of the code.

In future it will also be able to generate an outline application from an OpenAPI yaml document.

:::warning Works is a work in progress
Works will be private for some time while it's under development.
