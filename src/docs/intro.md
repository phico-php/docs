# Introduction

Phico is a lightweight PHP framework designed to be Simple to understand and Easy to use with Fast responses.

## Simple

Phico is a very small project that does very little, both the code base and scope are very small.
However Phico is also extremely capable, with add on packages it has a powerful SQL Query builder and with Blates a near feature complete standalone Blade renderer implementation.

## Easy

Phico contains a small number of packages with an easy to remember, consistent API to speed developer onboarding and flow.
Facades and hidden code are avoided but convenient helper functions are still provided.

## Fast

Phico can respond to requests in as little as 3ms on low end hardware.

It is also capable of leveraging the performance of Workerman to respond to tens of thousands of requests per second without breaking a sweat - say goodbye to complicated horizontal scaling for the majority of sites, because now you can serve 100-1000x the traffic on the same node.
