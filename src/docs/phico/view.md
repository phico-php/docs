# View
Phico ships with the POP renderer which is capable of rendering Plain Old PHP templates from files on disk or strings in variables.

Phico supports the following renderers through the Phico view adapter packages.
- **Blates** A Blade compatible view renderer, around 90% of Blade syntax is supported.
- **Plates** The Plates view renderer from the PHP League.
- **Twig** The Twig view renderer from symfony.
- **Latte** The Latte view renderer from Nette.

## Supported renderers
### Blates (Blade)
Blades is a fork of the Plates renderer (see below) which caches templates to disk before converting them to plain PHP syntax for processing via Plates.
See the [Blates](https://github.com/indgy/blates) package repo for more details.

### Latte
The first truly secure and intuitive templates for PHP.
See the [Latte](https://github.com/phico-php/latte) package repo for more details.

### Plates
Plates is a native PHP template system thatâ€™s fast, easy to use and easy to extend.
See the [Plates](https://github.com/phico-php/plates) package repo for more details.

### Twig
Twig is a modern template engine for PHP.
See the [Twig](https://github.com/phico-php/twig) package repo for more details.

## Config
Multiple renderers can be used at once, which makes it very easy to mix and match templates and gradually swap between templating engines as needed.
```php
<?php

return [

    'use' => env('VIEWS_USE', 'plates'),

    'renderers' => [
        // configure the plates renderer
        'plates' => [
            'file_extension' => env('VIEWS_FILE_EXTENSION', 'plates.php'),
            'default_path' => env('VIEWS_DEFAULT_PATH', 'app/Common/Views'),
            'folders' => [
                'account' => 'app/Account/Views',
                'auth' => 'app/Auth/Views',
            ],
            'functions' => [],
            'extensions' => [],
        ],

        // configure the twig renderer
        'twig' => [
            'file_extension' => env('VIEWS_FILE_EXTENSION', 'twig.html'),
            'default_path' => env('VIEWS_DEFAULT_PATH', 'app/Common/Views'),
            'folders' => [
                'account' => 'app/Account/Views',
                'auth' => 'app/Auth/Views',
            ],
            'functions' => [],
            'extensions' => [],
        ],

    ],

];
```
## Helper
Use the `view()` helper to render templates with data.
```php
// return a response containing the rendered HTML
return response()->html(
    view()->render("auth::login", $this->input($request));
);
```

### Switching renderers
The _View_ instance can switch between configured templating engines using the `use()` method.
```php
view()->use("twig")->render()
```

### Rendering templates
Call the `render()` or `template()` method to render a template file.
```php
view("blade")->render("users::welcome", ["name" => "Phico"]);
// will render welcome.blade.php in the configured users module folder
```

### Rendering strings
_View_ can render plain strings if needed.
<br>Take extreme care where the string has come from, **do not use untrusted input**.
```php
view()->string("Hello {{ name }}", ["name" => "World"]);
```
