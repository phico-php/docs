# Phico is a lightweight, dependency free PHP framework.

# It can be thought of as a simple Request-Response handler, all Phico does is
# accept Requests from a client and Routes them to your code via the built-in
# Router.

# Your code must respond with a Response which is returned to the client.

# If you need any further functionality you can add middleware to adjust the
# Request on it's way to your code, or adjust the Reponse on it's way back to the
# client.

# Though Phico follows a similar pattern to many PSRs it is not directly compatible,
# Phico is designed to follow it's own path and is not encumbered by external projects.

# Phico is entirely dependency free* and will remain that way by keeping it's
# purpose laser focused. Additional functionality can be handled by additional
# packages or your custom code.

# *Except dev dependencies and reliance on some 3rd party packages in the addons
